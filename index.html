       <center> Due to long term health issue, I feel tired and lack energy.
        I am currently tring to drop the course. If I failed to drop it as it's 
        one week passed the deadline, then 
        I may probably get back to finish the project. Thank you everyone who clicked in to view the website!!! </center>
